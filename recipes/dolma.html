    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Dolma, a cherished dish across various Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines, embodies a delightful fusion of flavors and textures. At its core, dolma consists of grape leaves stuffed with a tantalizing mixture of seasoned rice, aromatic herbs, and sometimes ground meat, creating a harmonious balance of savory and herbaceous notes. The grape leaves, tender and delicately tangy, envelop the filling, infusing it with their unique essence during the cooking process. Whether served warm or chilled, dolma offers a culinary experience that transports diners to sun-drenched Mediterranean landscapes, where each bite unfolds with layers of tradition and culinary craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>Originating from ancient Anatolia and spreading throughout the Levant and beyond, dolma has evolved into a versatile dish with countless regional variations. While grape leaves are the most traditional wrapping, other vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers are also used to encase the flavorful filling, each contributing its own distinctive character. Whether enjoyed as a vibrant appetizer, a satisfying main course, or a festive addition to celebratory feasts, dolma continues to captivate palates worldwide with its timeless charm and irresistible allure, inviting diners on a culinary journey rich in culture and tradition.</p>
