        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p> Borscht, a beloved staple of Eastern European cuisine, is a hearty and vibrant soup renowned for its rich flavor and striking crimson hue. At its heart lies the humble beetroot, which infuses the soup with its earthy sweetness and distinctive color. This root vegetable is simmered alongside an array of complementary ingredients such as cabbage, potatoes, carrots, and onions, creating a robust and nourishing base. Often enhanced with tender chunks of beef or pork, borscht offers a satisfying depth of flavor that evolves with each spoonful.</p>
            <p>Traditionally seasoned with garlic, dill, and a dollop of tangy sour cream, borscht embodies the comforting essence of home-cooked meals shared with loved ones. Whether enjoyed steaming hot during chilly winters or chilled for a refreshing summer delight, borscht holds a cherished place in the hearts and kitchens of those who appreciate its simple yet satisfying charm.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables: </strong>Peel and dice the beetroots, carrots, potatoes, and onions. Shred the cabbage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and sauté until they're translucent. Then, add the diced carrots and cook for a few minutes until they start to soften.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Beetroots and Cabbage:</strong>Stir in the diced beetroots and shredded cabbage. Sauté for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Broth and Seasonings: </strong>Pour in the beef or vegetable broth, along with tomato paste or chopped tomatoes. Add a couple of bay leaves for flavor. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
                <li><strong>Simmer:</strong>Once the soup is simmering, cover the pot and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the flavors have melded together.</li>
                <li><strong>Optional Meat:</strong>If you're using meat, such as beef or pork, you can add it at this stage. Simply add the diced meat to the pot along with the vegetables and let it cook until it's fully cooked through.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust Seasonings:</strong>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or even a splash of vinegar or lemon juice for acidity if desired.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Ladle the hot borscht into bowls. Garnish each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh dill.</li>
