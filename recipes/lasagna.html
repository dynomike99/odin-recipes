     <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, sautéing until softened and fragrant. If using ground meat, add it to the skillet and cook until browned. Pour in your tomato-based sauce (marinara or Bolognese), and season with salt, pepper, and herbs (like basil and oregano). Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the cheese filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Let it rest:</strong> Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice the lasagna into squares and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade lasagna with a side of garlic bread and a fresh salad for a complete meal.</li>
        </ol>
