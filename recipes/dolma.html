    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Dolma, a cherished dish across various Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines, embodies a delightful fusion of flavors and textures. At its core, dolma consists of grape leaves stuffed with a tantalizing mixture of seasoned rice, aromatic herbs, and sometimes ground meat, creating a harmonious balance of savory and herbaceous notes. The grape leaves, tender and delicately tangy, envelop the filling, infusing it with their unique essence during the cooking process. Whether served warm or chilled, dolma offers a culinary experience that transports diners to sun-drenched Mediterranean landscapes, where each bite unfolds with layers of tradition and culinary craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>Originating from ancient Anatolia and spreading throughout the Levant and beyond, dolma has evolved into a versatile dish with countless regional variations. While grape leaves are the most traditional wrapping, other vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers are also used to encase the flavorful filling, each contributing its own distinctive character. Whether enjoyed as a vibrant appetizer, a satisfying main course, or a festive addition to celebratory feasts, dolma continues to captivate palates worldwide with its timeless charm and irresistible allure, inviting diners on a culinary journey rich in culture and tradition.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Grape leaves (fresh or preserved)</li>
            <li>Rice (typically short or medium-grain)</li>
            <li>Ground meat (such as lamb, beef, or a mixture)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs (such as parsley, dill, and mint)</li>
            <li>Spices (such as cinnamon, allspice, and black pepper)</li>
            <li>Tomato paste or diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Optional additions: pine nuts, currants, or other dried fruits for added flavor and texture.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Grape Leaves:</strong> If you're using preserved grape leaves, rinse them under cold water to remove excess salt or brine. If you're using fresh grape leaves, blanch them in boiling water for a minute or two to soften them. Then, drain and set them aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine rice, finely diced onion, minced garlic, ground meat (if using), chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, dill, and mint), lemon juice, olive oil, tomato paste or diced tomatoes, and spices (such as salt, pepper, cinnamon, and allspice). Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Stuff the Grape Leaves:</strong> Lay a grape leaf flat on a clean work surface, smooth side down and rib side up. Place a spoonful of the filling (about 1-2 tablespoons, depending on the size of the grape leaf) near the stem end of the leaf. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it up tightly, tucking in the sides as you go. Repeat with the remaining grape leaves and filling.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrange in a Pot:</strong> Line the bottom of a large pot with a few grape leaves to prevent sticking. Arrange the stuffed grape leaves seam side down in the pot, packing them snugly together in a single layer. You can stack the dolma in multiple layers if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Pour enough water or broth over the dolma to cover them completely. Place a heatproof plate or lid directly on top of the dolma to keep them submerged during cooking. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the rice is cooked and the grape leaves are tender.</li>\
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once cooked, remove the dolma from the pot using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a serving platter. Serve dolma warm or at room temperature, garnished with lemon wedges and fresh herbs if desired.</li>
        </ol>
